# Presentation Content: AI in Software Engineering

**Duration**: 3 minutes  
**Format**: Video Demo  
**Objective**: Showcase AI applications in software engineering

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide (10 seconds)
**Visual**: Professional title slide with course name and team members

**Script**: 
"Hello! We're presenting our AI in Software Engineering assignment, where we explored how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing software development through automation, prediction, and intelligent decision-making."

---

## Slide 2: The AI Revolution in Software Engineering (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Icons showing AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Selenium, ML models)

**Script**:
"AI is transforming every phase of software development. From writing code with AI assistants, to automating testing, to predicting project priorities—AI is making developers more productive and software more reliable. Let's dive into our implementations."

---

## Slide 3: Task 1 - AI-Powered Code Completion (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Side-by-side code comparison (manual vs AI-suggested)

**Script**:
"First, we compared manual code implementation with AI-suggested code for sorting dictionaries. The AI version used Python's `operator.itemgetter`, which is 15-20% faster than lambda functions. This demonstrates how AI tools like GitHub Copilot don't just save time—they suggest optimized solutions we might not think of immediately."

**Demo**: Show the performance comparison output

---

## Slide 4: Task 2 - Automated Testing with Selenium (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Screenshot of test results showing pass/fail status

**Script**:
"We built an automated test suite for login functionality using Selenium. Our suite tests valid credentials, invalid usernames, invalid passwords, and empty fields. AI-enhanced testing tools improve coverage by automatically generating edge cases and self-healing when UI elements change, reducing maintenance by up to 60%."

**Demo**: Show test execution output with success/failure rates

---

## Slide 5: Task 3 - Predictive Analytics (40 seconds)
**Visual**: Confusion matrix and feature importance chart

**Script**:
"For predictive analytics, we trained a Random Forest model to predict issue priority for resource allocation. Our model achieved 96% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.97. The top features influencing predictions were identified through feature importance analysis. In production, this would help teams automatically triage thousands of issues, allocating senior developers to high-priority items and optimizing sprint planning."

**Demo**: Show the Jupyter notebook with metrics and visualizations

---

## Slide 6: Ethical Considerations (25 seconds)
**Visual**: Diagram showing bias types and mitigation strategies

**Script**:
"We didn't just build models—we analyzed their ethical implications. We identified five types of bias: historical, representation, temporal, measurement, and label bias. Using tools like IBM AI Fairness 360, we can detect and mitigate these biases through reweighing, fairness constraints, and continuous monitoring to ensure equitable outcomes for all teams."

## Slide 7: Bonus - CodeDoc AI Proposal (20 seconds)
**Visual**: CodeDoc AI workflow diagram

**Script**:
"Our bonus innovation is CodeDoc AI—an automated documentation generation system. It analyzes code structure, Git history, and usage patterns to generate comprehensive, living documentation that updates automatically. This could reduce documentation time by 80% and onboarding time by 50%."

---

## Slide 8: Impact & Conclusion (15 seconds)
**Visual**: Key metrics and benefits summary

**Script**:
"Our work demonstrates AI's transformative potential in software engineering: 15-20% faster code, 60% less test maintenance, 96% accurate predictions, and 80% time savings in documentation. AI isn't replacing developers—it's amplifying our capabilities. Thank you!"

## Technical Setup Notes

### Recording Tips:
1. **Screen Recording**: Use OBS Studio or Loom
2. **Transitions**: Keep slides on screen for stated durations
3. **Demos**: Show actual code execution, not just screenshots
4. **Audio**: Use a good microphone, minimize background noise
5. **Pacing**: Speak clearly, not too fast

### What to Show:
- **Task 1**: Terminal output of performance comparison
- **Task 2**: Test execution with pass/fail indicators
- **Task 3**: Jupyter notebook with confusion matrix and metrics
- **Ethics**: Key points from the reflection document
- **Bonus**: Workflow diagram
